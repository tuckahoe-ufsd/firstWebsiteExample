    <p>Welcome to my website. I hope together using this we will gain more understanding about how web design works. HTML is a quite an interesting technology that is considered one of the "core" web technologies. Along with CSS and Javascript you can make very exciting websites.</p>
    <h4>Why do we need to use HTML?</h4>
    <p>HTML is needed because when we put content on the internet we really arent creating it. HTML is a markup language, when you want to go to a URL your browser requests the website. Then the browser accesses the HTML file and <strong>parses</strong> or translates the HTML into a DOM (more on that later). After the DOM is constructed the browser renders the HTML and CSS files in order to accurately display the website. </p>

    <h4>Is HTML programming</h4>
    <p>The shortest answer is no, HTML will prepare you for programming, but its <i>technically</i> not a programming langauge. HTML is missing several features to be considered a coding language, such as logic handling, no ability to store variables, dependent on variables etc. Learn more <a href="https://www.theserverside.com/feature/Is-HTML-a-programming-language#:~:text=HTML%20is%20not%20a%20computer%20programming%20language%20for%20three%20reasons,provide%20any%20iterative%20looping%20structures">here</a>.  </p>
    <h4>What Programming language is best?</h4>
    <p>Well that fully depends on what you want to do really, the exciting thing about programming is that once you learn on language, you can have an easier time picking up the other. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syntax_(programming_languages)">syntax</a> is just different. Python is a great general purpose langauge, it can do many different things and has a lot of uses like web development, machine learning, data science, scripting, and automation. Javascipt is heavily used in web development and the development of mobile applications, Java is an extremely reliable programming langauge that powers many enterprise systems, applications, Operating Systems and other software. C++ and C# are used extensively in game design for the speed of the langauge, which is neccessary in video games. We have newer programming langauge like Go, which aims to be one of the easiest programming langauges. A lot of times people in computer science will use several different languages to accomplish the task they need done. </p>

    <h4>What is the hardest part of learning to code</h4>
    <p>Many students find computer science challenging, one student said <q>I think computer science is super difficult because I havent ever done anything like it. When I need help I need to use Google or other resources and its different than my other classes.</q> Computer Science is a learning process, its like learning how to make a house out of bricks, I wont tell you to buid the house first, I need to teach you how to make a brick, then make a wall first.</p>
